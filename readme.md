## Weather App

## Description: Created a Weather App from a prototype that utilizes BootStrap's library of components and CSS presets. The weather app pulls data from multiple OpenWeather's api so searched for locations temps and 5-day forecast are displayed, as well grabbing the user's current location, and displaying it to the DOM.

## Peer Review #1 (Joseph) - the code works and looks great. i really liked how you where able to get the moving image in the background, one issue i seen was that the bottom of the image was not filling the screen(this was actually just an issue with my own screen size -jd)

## Peer Review #2 (Name here) -
