## Weather App

## Description: Created a Weather App from a prototype that utilizes BootStrap's library of components and CSS presets. The weather app pulls data from multiple OpenWeather's api so searched for locations temps and 5-day forecast are displayed, as well grabbing the user's current location, and displaying it to the DOM.
